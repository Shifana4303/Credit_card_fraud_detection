CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

This project implements a machine learning–based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data. A Logistic Regression model is trained with imbalance handling techniques and deployed using a Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.

Features
- Binary classification: Fraud vs Non-Fraud
- Handles highly imbalanced data using SMOTE
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression–based classification
- Streamlit web interface for user interaction
- Trained model and scaler saved using Pickle

Features Used
- Transaction Amount
- Latitude & Longitude
- Merchant Latitude & Longitude
- Transaction Hour
- Transaction Day
- Transaction Month
- Gender

Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- streamlit

How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Train the model
5. Run the Streamlit application

Training the Model
Run the following command:
python train.py

This will generate:
- logistic_regression_model.pkl
- scaler.pkl

Running the Application
Run the following command:
streamlit run app.py

Enter transaction details in the UI and click **Check For Fraud** to get predictions.

Results
- Logistic Regression achieves good performance after applying SMOTE
- Model effectively detects fraudulent transactions
- Suitable for real-time fraud detection use cases

Future Work
- Implement advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add transaction visualization and analytics
- Deploy the application to cloud platforms
- Improve feature engineering and accuracy
